        They fall in line
One at a time
Ready to play
(I can't see them anyway)
No time to lose
We've got to move
Steady your helm
(I am losing sight again)
Fire your guns
It's time to run
Blow me away
(I will stay in the mess I made)
After the fall
We'll shake it off
Show me the way
Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to Heaven when we die
I am the shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all
There's nothing left
So save your breath
Lying in wait
(Caught inside this tidal wave)
Your cover's blown
Nowhere to go
Holding your fate
(Loaded I will walk alone)
Fire your guns
It's time to run
Blow me away
(I will stay in the mess I made)
After the fall
We'll shake it off
Show me the way
Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to Heaven when we die
I am the shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all
You wanted it back (Don't make me mad)
(Here it comes)
Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to Heaven when we die
I am the shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all
Save us all!
