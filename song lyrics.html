    <pre>
        Finished with my woman
        'Cause she couldn't help me with my mind
        People think I'm insane
        Because I am frowning all the time
        
        All day long I think of things
        But nothing seems to satisfy
        Think I'll lose my mind
        If I don't find something to pacify
        
        Can you help me
        Occupy my brain?
        Oh yeah
        
        I need someone to show me
        The things in life that I can't find
        I can't see the things that make true happiness
        I must be blind
        
        Make a joke and I will sigh
        And you will laugh and I will cry
        Happiness I cannot feel
        And love to me is so unreal
        
        And so, as you hear these words
        Telling you now of my state
        I tell you to enjoy life
        I wish I could but it's too late
    </pre>
